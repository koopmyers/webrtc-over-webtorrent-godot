# WebRTC over Webtorrent in Godot

This Godot project is a proof of concept for creating and connecting players over the internet with the only requirement to pass a short password between players. It uses WebRTC peer to peer connection without the need to deploy a signaling server, using public WebTorrent Trackers.

It is limited and is not ready for full real use. It is missing basic functionalities for a production project like troubleshooting, proper closing connections and session, timeoutâ€¦

It is recommended to use multiple trackers as they can be unreliable.

To test it, just run the project in Godot, and create a session with one peer and connect other peers using the session id generated.
